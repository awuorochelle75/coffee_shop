# Coffee Shop Domain Modelling

## **Description**
This project models a Coffee Shop domain using object-oriented programming principles in python.The application defines three main entities:'Customer','Coffee', and 'Order' and establishes their relationships to simulate a simple coffee ordering system.
## Project Structure
- 'customer.py' - defines the 'Customer' class with properties,order management and aggregate methods.
- 'coffee.py' - defines the 'Coffee' class with order tracking and statistics methods.
- 'order.py' - defines the 'Order' class linking 'Customer' and 'Coffee' instances with a price attribute.
- 'debug.py' - a script to manually test the domain model functionality interactively.
